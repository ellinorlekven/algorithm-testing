"""
A* Path Finding Algorithm Visualization Module

This module provides a visualization tool for the A* path-finding algorithm using Pygame. 
It defines a Spot class representing nodes in the grid and includes functions for creating 
the grid, drawing nodes, and implementing the A* algorithm.

Functions:
---------
h(p1, p2):
    Calculate the Manhattan distance heuristic between two points.

reconstruct_path(came_from, current, draw):
    Reconstruct the shortest path and mark the nodes that belong to the path.

algorithm(draw, grid, start, end):
    The A* path-finding algorithm implementation.

make_grid(rows, width):
    Create a 2D grid of Spot instances based on the number of rows and the width of the window.

draw_grid(win, rows, width):
    Draw grid lines on the visualization window.

draw(win, grid, rows, width):
    Draw the current state of the grid and nodes on the visualization window.

get_clicked_pos(pos, rows, width):
    Get the row and column of the clicked node based on the mouse position.

main(win, width):
    The main function to run the A* path-finding visualization.
