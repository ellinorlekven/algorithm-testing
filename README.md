# algorithm-testing
This repositpry is made for testing algorithms in Python. The motivation behind it is to better understand what happens behind Machine Learning Models. The repositpry will also include testing of libraries in Python that is used for Machine Learnning Models and Artificial Intelligence Models. 

## A* algorithm 
The A* algorithm is a versatile pathfinding and traversal method, ideal for determining the shortest path from a starting point to a goal node in a graph or grid-like setting. It handles varying edge costs efficiently, making it applicable to both uniform and weighted grid graphs, often encountered in maps or game environments. A* utilizes a heuristic (or approximation) function to guide its search effectively, enabling it to explore promising paths early on, resulting in faster convergence to the optimal solution.

astar.py contains my implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm in Python. The code and comments have been written by me. However, I drew significant inspiration and knowledge from [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg) and his tutorial on the A* algorithm.
