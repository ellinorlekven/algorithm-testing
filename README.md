# algorithm-testing
This repository is designed for the purpose of experimenting with Python algorithms. The aim is to delve into the underlying mechanics of Machine Learning Models, encompassing the evaluation of Python libraries utilized for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Models.

## A* algorithm 
The A* algorithm is a versatile pathfinding and traversal method, ideal for determining the shortest path from a starting point to a goal node in a graph or grid-like setting. It handles varying edge costs efficiently, making it applicable to both uniform and weighted grid graphs, often encountered in maps or game environments. A* utilizes a heuristic (or approximation) function to guide its search effectively, enabling it to explore promising paths early on, resulting in faster convergence to the optimal solution.

astar.py contains my implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm in Python. The code and comments have been written by me. However, I drew significant inspiration and knowledge from [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg) and his tutorial on the A* algorithm.


## TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive platform for building and deploying various machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, for tasks such as classification, regression, image and speech recognition, and more. The files in this folder includes my self-written code taken from Nicholas Renotte's video: [TensorFlow in 10 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2hzRopPbQ)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2hzRopPbQ

## Neural Network from Scratch
A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain's interconnected neurons. It is a fundamental concept in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Building it from scracth makes it easier to problem solve when facing ML-problems in the future. The Neural Network from Scratch folder includes code that is written while watching the YouTube playlist [Neural Networks from Scracth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3)https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3 made by sentdex
